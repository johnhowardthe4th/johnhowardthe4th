👀 I’m interested in coding for fun.

🌱 I’m currently learning expression of heart in all I do in my daily life.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and network ... really do, fr lets share code.

PS: I love freedom (not jaded, still is what I want for our time here),

PSS: I am not the presy of the outback.
